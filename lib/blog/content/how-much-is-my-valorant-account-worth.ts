## Weapon Skin Priorities

### Most Valuable Weapons to Have Skins For

Buyers prioritize these weapons (in order):

1. **Vandal** - Most used rifle
2. **Phantom** - Second most used rifle
3. **Operator** - Primary AWP equivalent
4. **Knife/Melee** - Always visible
5. **Spectre** - Popular SMG
6. **Sheriff** - Popular pistol
7. **Ghost** - Starter pistol

**Premium Tip:** An account with a stacked Vandal collection (5+ premium skins) is more valuable than one with skins spread across unpopular weapons.

## Common Valuation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Overvaluing Recent Battle Pass Items

**Reality:** Current and recent battle pass items add minimal value since everyone can get them.

### Mistake 2: Counting Every Skin Equally

**Reality:** 50 random skins does not equal 20 premium skins. Quality over quantity.

### Mistake 3: Using Purchase Price as Value

**Reality:** What you spent doesn't equal market value. A $100 bundle might only add $30-50 to account value.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Region

**Reality:** NA and EU accounts typically sell for 10-20% more than other regions.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting Act Rank History

**Reality:** Consistent high ranks across multiple acts adds significant value.

## Platform and Region Considerations

### Region Pricing Differences

| Region | Price Modifier |
|--------|----------------|
| North America | 100% (baseline) |
| Europe | 95-100% |
| Asia Pacific | 80-90% |
| Brazil/LATAM | 75-85% |
| Korea | 90-100% |

### Account Transfer Notes

- Riot accounts are region-locked
- Region transfers may be possible (check current policy)
- Buyer region preference affects demand

## Market Research Tips

### How to Research Current Prices

1. **Browse Nashflare listings** - See comparable accounts
2. **Check recent sales** - Completed transactions show real prices
3. **Compare skin collections** - Match your inventory to listings
4. **Factor in rank decay** - Recent inactivity may lower rank

### Price Fluctuations

**Prices Increase When:**
- New competitive season starts
- VCT tournaments drive interest
- New popular agents release
- Holiday shopping seasons

**Prices Decrease When:**
- Mass account selling periods
- Game meta shifts negatively
- End of competitive season
