Fortnite Chapter 7 has completely transformed the game with its Hollywood-themed Pacific Break season. From surfing into matches on tsunami waves to the Kill Bill collaboration, this chapter brings massive changes that affect both gameplay and account values. Whether you're looking to buy a stacked account or sell yours, here's everything you need to know.

## What's New in Fortnite Chapter 7

Chapter 7: Pacific Break launched on November 29, 2025, bringing one of the biggest overhauls in Fortnite history. The Hollywood and West Coast theme has introduced an entirely new map, weapons, and mechanics that change how the game plays.

### The Battle Bus is Gone (For Now)

In a shocking change, players no longer drop from the Battle Bus. Instead, you surf into the map on a tsunami wave from the storm. This fundamentally changes early game strategy since you can't fly to distant locations - you're tied to where the wave brings you.

The good news? There are quests to rebuild the Battle Bus, suggesting it may return later in the season.

### New Map: The Golden Coast

The Chapter 7 map features a completely new island inspired by Los Angeles and Hollywood. Key locations include studios, beaches, and urban environments that feel completely different from previous chapters.

### Kill Bill Collaboration

The headline collaboration features Uma Thurman's The Bride from the Kill Bill movies, along with Yuki Yubari - a character whose chapter was cut from the original film. This is a premium collaboration that's already becoming highly sought-after.

### Key Gameplay Changes

**Drivable Reboot Vans** - You can now drive Reboot Vans and revive knocked teammates while on the move.

**Self-Revive Items** - A game-changing addition that lets you revive yourself when downed, purchasable from med machines.

**Boss Transformation** - Defeating bosses now drops items that let you become them, wearing their skin and gaining their abilities.

**Storm Anomalies** - Random events during storm phases that can summon loot or grant powerful effects.

**Bars No Longer Carry Over** - You must spend your Gold Bars before each match ends.

## Chapter 7 Battle Pass Skins

The Season 1 Battle Pass includes 8 skins with two major collaborations:

**Collaboration Skins:**
- The Bride (Kill Bill)
- Marty McFly (Back to the Future)

**Original Skins:**
- Miles Cross
- Cat Holloway
- Dark Voyager (new version of classic skin)
- Lion Man character
- And more original designs

## What Makes Chapter 7 Accounts Valuable

With the new chapter comes new factors that determine account value. Here's what buyers are looking for:

### High-Value Chapter 7 Items

**The Bride Skin** - As a premium collaboration skin, The Bride is already commanding high interest. Kill Bill fans and collectors want this skin.

**Yuki Yubari** - The free login reward skin (available November 27 - December 1) is actually quite valuable since many players missed the window.

**Battle Pass Progress** - Accounts with significant Battle Pass progress are worth more since buyers skip the grind.

**Marty McFly** - Another premium collaboration that Back to the Future fans are seeking.

### Winterfest 2025 Items

Winterfest 2025 is currently running, adding:
- Holiday-themed skins
- Snow covering half the map
- Crackshot's Cabin return
- Clawsy Lodge (replacing Paws Inn)
- Festive cosmetics and rewards

Accounts with completed Winterfest rewards become more valuable after the event ends.

## OG Skins Still Dominate Value

### Tier 1: Ultra Rare ($500-$3000+)
- Renegade Raider
