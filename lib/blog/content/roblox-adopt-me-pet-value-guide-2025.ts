| Mega Neon | 4 Luminous Neons | 12-16x value |

**Example:**

**Pro Tip:** Mega versions of even mid-tier pets can be worth more than regular top-tier pets due to the effort required.

## Age Matters: Pet Growth Stages

Pet age affects both trading value and Neon-making:

| Junior | ~5 tasks | Still low |
| Pre-Teen | ~10 tasks | Below average |
| Teen | ~15 tasks | Average |
| Post-Teen | ~20 tasks | Above average |
| Full Grown | ~25 tasks | Highest (Neon-ready) |

**Full Grown pets** are worth more because they can be immediately combined into Neons.
