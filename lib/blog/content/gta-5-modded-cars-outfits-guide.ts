While money and rank are important, what really sets premium accounts apart are the modded cars and outfits - custom vehicles and clothing combinations that are impossible to obtain through normal gameplay.

This guide covers everything you need to know about modded cars, rare vehicles, custom outfits, and what to look for when buying a GTA 5 account with these features.

## Risks and Considerations

### Ban Risk for Modded Content

**Current Situation:**
- Rockstar focuses on money/RP glitches
- Cosmetic mods lower priority
- No mass bans for modded cars/outfits
- Individual bans rare for just cosmetics

**Higher Risk:**
- Obvious impossible items
- Bragging in public lobbies
- Extreme mods (flying cars, etc.)

**Lower Risk:**
- Cosmetic-only modifications
- Subtle color changes
- Private/invite-only sessions
- Normal gameplay patterns

### Keeping Modded Items Safe

**Best Practices:**
- Don't modify modded vehicles
- Keep outfits saved properly
- Avoid drawing Rockstar attention
- Play normally

**What Can Remove Mods:**
- Certain game updates (rare)
- Modifying the vehicle yourself
- Taking to Los Santos Customs carelessly
- Rockstar support tickets

## How Modded Accounts Are Created

### Vehicle Modding Methods

**Common Techniques:**
- GCTF (Give Cars to Friends) glitches
- Merge glitches
- Frozen money methods
- Direct modification tools

**Console vs. PC:**
- Console mods are glitch-based
- PC mods can use external tools
- Both result in similar items

### Outfit Creation Methods

**Glitch-Based:**
- Telescope glitch
- Job teleport methods
- Component transfer glitches
- Saved outfit manipulation

**Why It Matters:**
Glitch-based mods are safer than injected mods.
