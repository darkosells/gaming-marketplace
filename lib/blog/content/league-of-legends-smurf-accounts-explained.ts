# Introduction

Smurf accounts have become an integral part of League of Legends culture. Whether you're a high-ELO player looking to practice new roles, a content creator needing multiple accounts, or someone wanting a fresh start, understanding smurf accounts is essential. This comprehensive guide covers everything from what smurf accounts are to how to safely purchase and use them.

## What is a Smurf Account?

### Definition

A smurf account is a secondary League of Legends account used by a player who already has a main account. The term originated from professional players "Smurf" and "PapaSmurf" who created alternate accounts to play anonymously.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Lower rank than player's main account (initially)
- Used for various purposes beyond main account
- Typically has different summoner name
- May have different role focus or champion pool

### Smurf vs. Alt Account

**Smurf Account:**
- Significantly lower MMR than main
- Often used to play with friends
- May be used to practice off-roles
- Sometimes used to "stomp" lower ranks

**Alt Account:**
- Similar skill level to main
- Used for queue dodging main account penalties
- Backup when main is banned/suspended
- Different region or server

## Why Players Use Smurf Accounts

### Playing with Friends
